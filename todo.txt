    what will the game need to function? {

                                notifications remove it. eg, if you bump into a wall,
                                printqueue "you bumped into $something", not facing
            recognize if tile at coords is an entity
            if entity, run func tied to that entity (see entities)
        entities
            funcs tied to entities that can:
            move player (pathway)
            manipulate inventory
            manipulate entities
                eg unlock door (change from locked door to open door)
                eg pick up item (removes item, replaces it with floor tile)
            
        
    }
    
    update()
    render()
    def update():
        get userinput
        process userinput
        run game by one game tick
        figure out what to print in render
    def render():
        print what we need
    
    
    how can we load the map?
    method 1 {
        all the maps stored as arrays
        variable keeping track of what the values inside arrays
        kept separately
        pseduocode {
            map[][] = // implementation
            update() {
                if 
            }
        }
    }
    method 2 {
        basic map outline stored
        variable keepign track of entities loads entities onto screen on update() before render()
    }
}

notes:
entities can use keys


eg door w/o key cannot open. door w/ key can open.
{
    // TODO: where would this go?
    // pseudocode
    interact(coords);

    def interact(coords):
        switch coords:
            case coords == coordsOfDoor1:
                tryOpenDoor1();
            case coords == coordsOfDoor2:
                tryOpenDoor2();
            finally: return false;

    def tryOpenDoor1():
        if(haveKey):
            openDoor();
        else:
            printToGame("you dont have key");

}
